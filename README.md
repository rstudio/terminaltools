RStudio Addins
==============

This package provides a set of addins related to the RStudio terminal.

When RStudio is launched, it will automatically discover addins registered by
installed R packages, and register them so that they can be invoked through
keyboard shortcuts and other UI gestures. See the
[RStudio Addins website](http://rstudio.github.io/rstudioaddins/)
for more details.
